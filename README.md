  When the user submits their location, JavaScript retrieves the input value and constructs a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the location information.
  After receiving a response from the API, JavaScript parses the weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and updates the UI to display this information to the user.

  You've registered for an API key from OpenWeatherMap and included it in your API requests to authenticate and access weather data.
